# Design-System Adoption Report

Generated from `design-system/ai/index.json` and `design-system/ai/metadata/` by `adoption-report.py`. Re-run after code changes.

## Freshness

- Index version: `0.2.0` (astro)
- Index generated at: `2026-07-10T10:10:09.961634+00:00`
- Metadata files: 25 (AadithCompanion, BaseLayout, BrandLockup, CaseStudySection, DecryptedText, DottedIndiaMap, FeaturedWork, Footer, GridBackdrop, Header, Hero, HoverRevealList, LabCard, LetterGlitch, Line, PixelTransition, ProfileSignals, ProjectHero, ProjectNav, Reveal, SectionLabel, TrueFocus, WorkGate, WorkItemIndex, WorkingLoopMap)
- Caveat: utilization is static import-based; dynamic or runtime-only references may need manual review.

### Components not directly imported

- None — every component is imported somewhere.

## Metadata coverage

Components documented in `metadata/`: **25 / 25**.

## Automated risk flags

- No structural risks detected: all components are used and documented.

## Adoption summary

The Astro portfolio runs an organism-led system: a `BaseLayout` shell, a data-driven `CaseStudySection`, the `HoverRevealList` work index, and the `LabCard` Lab grid are reusable and consistently tokenized. 25/25 components are imported and 25/25 are documented. The maintenance priority is to re-run the index/metadata/report generators on every component change so AI assistants keep choosing existing high-craft patterns before inventing new UI.
